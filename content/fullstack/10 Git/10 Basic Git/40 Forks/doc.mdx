When you want to collaborate with projects in which you don't have commit access, the usual procedure is this:

1. **Forking** the project: cloning the project as yours, but keeping a reference to the source project.

2. Making changes: you can make the modifications you want, which potentially are contributions to the project.

3. Do a **Pull Request**: Ask the original maintainer of the project to pull from your repo, since you have modifications that he might be interested in.

In this way, the maintainer of the project can decide if he wants to integrate your changes or not to keep the project going in the direction he wants to.
