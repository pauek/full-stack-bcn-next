[Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) is a modern layout algorithm that substitutes old ones. With it you can do almost everything.

### Display property

To activate this algorithm, change the `display` property of any element with CSS:

```css
article {
  display: flex;
}
```

Elements with `display: flex` can be a **column** (children laid out vertically) or a **row** (children laid out horizontally). To control this, use `flex-direction`:

```css
article {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}
```

### Axes

The **main axis** refers to the axis on which children are positioned, and has the property **`justify-content`**. The **cross axis** is the orthogonal one, property **`align-items`**.

The associated properties are:

| Axis  | Property          |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| main  | `justify-content` |
| cross | `align-items`     |

So the axes in both cases are:

| `flex-direction` | `justify-content` | `align-items` |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| `column`         | vertical          | horizontal    |
| `row`            | horizontal        | vertical      |

### Expanded elements

By default all elements have minimum dimensions, but some of them can have a **`flex`** number. If this number is different than 0 (the default), they expand in sharing the available space in proportion to their number.

```css
.parent {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}
.parent .child1 {
  flex: 1; /* will get half as big as child2, ratio 1:2 */
}
.parent .child2 {
  flex: 2; /* will get twice as big as child1, ratio 2:1 */
}
```
