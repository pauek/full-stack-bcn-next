In CSS the **`position`** property controls how elements are positioned and if they respect the layout algorithm. The default layout is `static`, so there is no need to set this property explicitly.

```css
header {
  position: static; /* no need, this is the default */
}
```

### Relative

A position of **`relative`** sets the current element's static position as the new _"reference box"_, for himself _and_ children.

The properties `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` set the distances to the edges of the "reference box". These can all be positive of negative.

```css
.advert {
  position: relative;
  top: -50px; /* move it up 50px */
}
```

### Absolute

A position of **`absolute`** removes the element from the layout computation (so it is positioned independently of all others), and it will just follow the `top`, `right`, `bottom` and `left` properties (with respect to the "reference box").

**`fixed`** is the same, but it will stay in place when you scroll.

**`sticky`** keeps the element at its normal position until you scroll, showing it in a fixed position when it would be out of the window.

In this example, the `button.close` will be at the top-right corner of the `.parent`:

```css
.parent {
  position: relative; /* .parent is now the reference box */
}
.parent button.close {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0; /* touch the upper edge */
  right: 0; /* touch the right edge */
}
```
