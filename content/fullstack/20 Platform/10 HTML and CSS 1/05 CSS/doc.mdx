CSS is a language specifying the style of pages. HTML is just for "abstract content", CSS decides how that content is shown. [Content and style separation](https://csszengarden.com) is a good specialization since designers can be mainly responsible for CSS and programmers or content managers for HTML.

### Styling HTML

1. Using a `<link>`:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
   ```

2. Puting a `<style>` tag the `<head>`.

3. Setting _inline_ styles:

   ```html
   <div style="background-color: red">I'm so, so hot!</div>
   ```

4. Importing styles from another CSS file:

   ```css
   /* in styles.css... */
   @import url(more-styles.css);
   ```

### CSS Syntax

A CSS file is just a _list of rules_. Each rule has a **selector**, a **property**, and a **value**. Whitespace is not important, and comments are like C region comments (`/*` and `*/`). It is important to use a formatter such as [Prettier](https://prettier.io).

Rules can be grouped with braces (`{` and `}`) so that they share the selector, but they are independent rules anyway. The following is a piece of CSS showing two rules applying to all paragraphs:

```css
p {
  color: #222;
  margin: 1rem 0;
}
```
