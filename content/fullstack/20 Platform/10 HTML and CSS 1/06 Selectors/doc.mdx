Selectors represents sets of elements, to which certain rules apply.

### By element type (tag)

The most basic selector selects _all elements_ of a certain type (with a certain **tag**), for instance:

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 24pt;
}
main {
  margin: 0;
}
p {
  padding: 0;
}
```

This CSS has 3 rules which apply to all first-level headers (`<h1>`), the `<main>` element (typically just one), and all paragraphs (`<p>`).

### Union or grouping

A comma between two selectors performs the set union of their sets:

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 24pt;
}
header {
  font-size: 24pt;
}
```

can be merged into:

```css
h1,
header {
  font-size: 24pt;
}
```

### Descendants

A descendant is an element inside another, at any level. Two selectors separated by a **space** represent an element of the second set inside an element of the first set.

```css
header a {
  color: green;
}
```

This rule sets the font color as green only for the anchors within the header.
