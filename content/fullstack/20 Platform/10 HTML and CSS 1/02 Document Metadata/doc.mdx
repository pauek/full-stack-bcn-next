The `<head>` tag contains metadata, which describes things that are not directly shown on the page itself.

### The title

The `<title>` tag gives a title to the page, which usually is displayed in the browser's tab. If that page is saved, the title is also used for the file.

```html
<title>A simple title</title>
```

### Links

Links are relationships between the document we are describing and other resources. These links can be of different types depending on the "relationship", abbreviated `rel` as an attribute. The `<link>` is a self-closing tag.

1. **Stylesheets**: `rel="stylesheet"`, to attach a CSS style-sheet to the page (can be used many times).

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css" />
   ```

2. **Stylesheets for specific media**: adding `media="..."` we can choose for what media is the stylesheet.

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" media="print" href="/print.css" />
   <link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (max-width: 600px)" href="/mobile.css" />
   ```

3. **Favicon**: `rel="icon"`, to describe what the icon of the page should be.

   ```html
   <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" />
   ```

4. **Preload**: To indicate files to preload, otherwise they are loaded on-demand, and preloading them can speed-up things quite a bit.

   ```html
   <link rel="preload" href="/fonts/my-font.woff2" as="font" />
   ```

### Styles

You can write styles inside the `<head>` element with a `<style>` tag,
using CSS directly embedded in the html.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      body {
        font-size: 20pt;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    This text will be large!
  </body>
</html>
```

### Scripts

You can also include scripts in the `<head>` with the `<script>` tag. Using both `<style>` and `<script>` allows you to send a self-contained web document.

### Metainformation

With the `<meta>` tag you can attach metainformation of various kinds to the document. The `<meta>` tag is an _empty tag_.

Examples:

1. Setting the **encoding**:

   ```html
   <meta charset="utf-8" />
   ```

2. **Description** of the website (good for SEO):

   ```html
   <meta name="description" content="A brief description of my website" />
   ```

3. Setting some **keywords** for your site (good for SEO):

   ```html
   <meta name="keywords" content="educational, course, programming" />
   ```

4. **Redirect** to another site after a certain number of seconds:

   ```html
   <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="3;https://www.upc.edu" />
   ```

There are many more, and some people have collected a [somewhat complete list of meta tags](https://gist.github.com/whitingx/3840905).
