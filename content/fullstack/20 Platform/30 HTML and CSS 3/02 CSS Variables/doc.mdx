[CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) let us assign values to names and reuse them throughout our whole application. Variables are defined as properties that start with two hyphens (`--`).

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: blue;
  --secondary-color: grey;
}
```

They are defined at a certain element and can be used on any descendant of that element, so you can scope variables to a part of your web app.

To use a variable invoke its value with `var()`:

```css
h1 {
  color: var(--primary-color);
}
```
