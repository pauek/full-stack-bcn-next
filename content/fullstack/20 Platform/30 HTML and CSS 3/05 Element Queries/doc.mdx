### Get Elements By

Three `document` methods let us search for elements in the 3 most typical ways:

- **`getElementsByTagName(tag)`**: (plural!) find all paragraphs, or all `h1`s.
- **`getElementById(id)`**: (singular!) find _the_ element with a certain `id`.
- **`getElementsByClassName(class)`**: (plural!) find all elements with a certain `class`.

### Query Selector

Two other methods let us search using CSS selectors, which are more powerful. This methods were introduced around 2008 to mirror the functionality that at the time provided a library called [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), which still exists:

- **`querySelector(sel)`**: Find the first element matching selector `sel`.
- **`querySelectorAll(sel)`**: Find _all_ elements matching selector `sel`.
