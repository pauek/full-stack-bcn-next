A form is in fact a **hyperlink** in which you can edit the URL query. The parameters are `<input>` elements with a **`name`** attribute.

```html
<form action="/addtask" method="get">
  <p>
    <label>Task <input type="text" name="task" /></label>
  </p>
  <p>
    <label>Minuts <input type="number" name="minutes" /></label>
  </p>
  <input type="submit" value="Add Task" />
</form>
```

If the task is "Kill Bill" with 90 minutes, the URL will be:

```
https://task-manager.com/addtask?task=Kill+Bill&min=90
```

### Structure

Parts of a form are usually `<p>`s, and every `<input>` element should have an associated `<label>`. The label can be associated with the `<input>` either by:

1. making the `<input>` a **child** of the `<label>` or,
2. using an `id` on the `<input>` and also the **`for`** attribute in the label.

Associating a `<label>` with every `<input>` improves accessibility and user interaction (clicking the `<label>` will focus the `<input>`).
