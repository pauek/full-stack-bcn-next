The browser performs 4 very important tasks with a document:

1. **fetching** its text,
2. **parsing** it,
3. **show** it on the screen, and
4. **listen** for events.

The Document Object Model (or DOM) is the internal in-memory representation of the document tree. The nodes in this tree are called **elements**. The DOM is what one can inspect using Chrome Developer Tools.

By using Javascript, one can query and manipulate the DOM in many ways. It is possible to:

1. traverse the tree,
2. search for elements,
3. change almost all properties of an element (content, styles, etc),
4. configure event handlers for elements,
5. delete elements,
6. create new elements and add them.

### The document object

The `document` global variable exists in browsers and allows a programmer to directly access the live DOM. It has some useful properties:

- **`location`**: the current URL as an object.
- **`URL`**: the current URL as a string.
- **`body`**: the body
- **`head`**: the head
- **`title`**: the title
- ...
