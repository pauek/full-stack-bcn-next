### The mongodb package

The [`mongodb`](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native) package implements connection with the MongoDB database and functionality very similar to that offered by `mongosh`. 

To start, just install the package:
```bash
npm install mongodb
```

To use the library, the first step is importing it and create a client, using a MongoDB connection URL.

```typescript
import mongodb from 'mongodb';

const url = "mongodb://admin:fullstack@localhost:27017?authSource=admin"
const client = new mongodb.MongoClient(url);
```

Once the client is created, we have to tell it to connect:
```typescript
await client.connect();
console.log("connected");
```

At this point, we have something akin to the `db` object in `mongosh`, with almost the same methods and signatures. We can obtain databases and collections and keep references to them:
```typescript
const db = client.db("russian");
const tweets = db.collection("tweets");
```

Make queries:
```typescript
const result = await tweets.find().limit(3).toArray();
console.log(result);
```

And in the end close the connection:
```typescript
client.close();
```
