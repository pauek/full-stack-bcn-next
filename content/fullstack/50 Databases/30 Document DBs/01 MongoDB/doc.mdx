### Setting up a MongoDB instance

Get the `databases/mongodb` sample

```bash
degit full-stack-bcn/samples/databases/mongodb mongodb
```

Change into the `mongodb/db` directory and launch Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Connect to the Mongo instance:

```bash
docker exec -it db-mongo-1 mongosh -u admin -p fullstack
```

### Collections and Documents

A database in MongoDB is a set of **collections**, each collection being a set of **documents**. Every document is a limited-size JSON-like object, which has a free JSON-like recursive structure.

Every object in MongoDB has an ID, which is always implicit and has the special name **`_id`**.

The Mongo Shell can be invoked with **`mongosh`** and it is a Javascript REPL, just like Node, but with extra commands. A global **`db`** object represents the open database.



### MongoShell commands

Show general help:

```bash
help
```

Show database help (all `db` methods with signatures):

```bash
db.help()
```

Show collection help:

```bash
db.todos.help()
```



(Just like with Node, pressing `TAB` shows available methods.)

#### Non-Javascript commands

Some commands are not Javascript, but very convenient:



Show all databases:

```bash
show dbs
```

Switch to a different database:

```bash
use foo
```

Show collections in this database:

```bash
show collections
```



### Executing script

To execute a script with Mongo Shell, you can pass it as the first arguments, just like with Node:

```bash
mongosh script.js
```

Once inside `mongosh`, you can load a script with:

```bash
load("script.js")
```

### Mongo Compass

[Mongo Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/es/products/compass) is a complete UI (probably made with Electron) which makes it easier to interact with MongoDB. You can connect either locally or on remote databases (especially [Mongo Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)).
