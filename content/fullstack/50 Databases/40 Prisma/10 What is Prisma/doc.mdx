[Prisma](https://prisma.io) is an ORM, i.e. an Object Relational Mapper. Prisma makes working with databases much easier because:
- We can define a [schema](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema) in a high-level language that works for multiple databases (Postgres, MySQL, SQLServer, SQLite, CockroachDB, MongoDB).
- It generates type-safe [client code](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client) in Typescript so that quering the database is easy and convenient.
- It synchronizes schema changes to the database, and also to [generates migration files](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate).
- It provides a [user-interface](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-studio) for your database on top of the generated client so that querying and editing data is easier.

### Project setup

The steps to prepare a new project for working with prisma are:



1. Create a Javascript package in a directory.
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```
2. Install Typescript as a dev-dependency with:
   ```bash
   npm install -D typescript ts-node @types/node
   ```
3. Initialize Typescript (create `tsconfig.json`):
   ```bash
   npx tsc --init
   ```
4. Install Prisma:
   ```bash
   npm install -D prisma
   ```
5. Set up Prisma with the `init` command:
   ```bash
   npx prisma init --datasource-provider sqlite
   ```
  


### The Prisma directory

The Prisma setup creates a subdirectory in your package called `prisma` which will contain:
- Your schema (`prisma.schema`).
- Migrations (empty at the beginning).

You should check this directory into Git.

### Prisma in VSCode

The [official Prisma extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma) for Visual Studio Code makes it much easier to work with `.prisma` files providing: 
- syntax highlighting, 
- formatting, 
- linting and autocompletion, 
- suggestions, and 
- jump-to-definition.
