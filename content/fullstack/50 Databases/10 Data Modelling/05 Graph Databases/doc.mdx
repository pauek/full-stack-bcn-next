### Databases storing graphs

A **graph** is probably the most flexible data-structure, made of _nodes_ and _links_ between them.

A collection of entities in a database table can be stored in a graph using nodes for the entities and links for the properties of each entity.

|             |            |                                                     |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Performance | _low/high_ | Depending on the query, they can be fast or slow    |
| Scalability | _high_     | Scaled by storing properties in different computers |
| Flexibility | _high_     | Don't need a schema internally (but can use one)    |
| Complexity  | _high_     | Almost as powerful as relational databases          |
| Recursivity | _high_     | Deep recursion can be handled with ease             |
