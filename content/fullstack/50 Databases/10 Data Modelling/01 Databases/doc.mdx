### Why do we need a database?

- **Persistence**: The data must be there even if the app crashes or stops.
- **Size**: Because data for most (real, useful) applications is much bigger than memory.
- **Concurrency**: We have multiple clients using the data at the same time.
- **Integrity**: We want to make sure that data is always consistent.
- **Selectivity**: We sometimes want to query very particular subsets of the data.

### Four database types

There are more, but the most used database types are:
- **Key-Value**: Big, associative tables.
- **Document**: Collections of documents.
- **Relational**: Sets of Tables (or relations) with relationships.
- **Graph**: Graphs with nodes as entities and edges as properties (most general).

### SQL vs NoSQL

**SQL** (Structured Query Language) is the dominant language for querying databases since the majority of databases are relational. 

Since the 2000s, the inflexibility of relational databases gave rise to a **NoSQL** movement, which encourages the use of alternative databases with different trade-offs. **NoSQL** represents almost all databases that are not relational.

### Database Features

We will study the 4 types of databases under the following 5 criteria:
- **Performance**: How fast can we write and query the database?
- **Scalability**: How easy it is to make the database 10x or 100x.
- **Flexibility**: How easy it is to adapt to new problems (modify its schema)?
- **Complexity**: How powerful and expressive is the engine and query language?
- **Recursivity**: How well does it handle recursive queries?
