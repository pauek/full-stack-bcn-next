This section uses prepared data about an old DVD Rental Business.

**`SELECT`** lists tuples in one or more tables:


```SQL
SELECT * FROM country;                   /* all columns */
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM actor; /* choose columns */
```



**`ORDER BY`** orders results:



```SQL
SELECT film_id, title FROM film 
  ORDER BY title;
SELECT customer_id, last_name, first_name FROM customer
  ORDER BY last_name, first_name DESC;
```




`ASC` is "ascending" and `DESC` "descending" order.

**`DISTINCT`** removes repetitions on results (only shows unique combinations):



```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT rental_rate FROM film;
SELECT DISTINCT district, postal_code FROM address ORDER BY district;
```
