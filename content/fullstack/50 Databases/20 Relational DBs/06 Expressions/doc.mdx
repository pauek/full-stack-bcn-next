|                             |                          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `<`                         | Less than                |
| `>`                         | Greater than             |
| `<=`                        | Less than or equal to    |
| `>=`                        | Greater than or equal to |
| `!=` or `<>`                | Not equal                |
| `BETWEEN` _x_ `AND` _y_     | *(Self-explanatory.)*    |
| `NOT BETWEEN` _x_ `AND` _y_ | *(Self-explanatory.)*    |
| `IS NULL`                   | *(Self-explanatory.)*    |
| `IS NOT NULL`               | *(Self-explanatory.)*    |



**`CASE`** transforms certain values into discrete categories:


```SQL
SELECT film_id, title, CASE 
    WHEN replacement_cost < 15 THEN 'low'
    WHEN replacement_cost < 25 THEN 'mid'
    ELSE 'high'
  END
  FROM film;
```



**`LIKE`** does light pattern matching on strings:


```SQL
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customer 
  WHERE last_name LIKE 'A%'; /* begins with 'A' */

SELECT film_id, title FROM film
  WHERE title LIKE '%al'; /* ends in 'al' */

SELECT film_id, title FROM film
  WHERE title LIKE '%war%'; /* title has 'war' somewhere */
```



**`IN`** checks that a value belongs to a set:


```SQL
SELECT customer_id, rental_id, return_date FROM rental
  WHERE customer_id IN (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  ORDER BY return_date DESC;

SELECT address_id, district, city_id FROM address
  WHERE city_id IN (
    SELECT city_id FROM city WHERE city LIKE 'A%'
  );
```
