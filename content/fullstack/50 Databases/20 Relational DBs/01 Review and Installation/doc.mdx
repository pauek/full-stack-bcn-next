### Features of Relational Databases

- Use [`SQL`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) as the query language.
- Have a **schema** that declares tables, with column types and constraints.
- Use **tables** to store relations (lists of entities).
- Implement relationships using **foreign keys** ("pointers").

A table is a way to represent a relation. It uses a bidimensional representation with *columns* (attributes) and *rows* (entities):

### Launching Postgres with Docker Compose

A simple way to launch a Postgres server is the following:

1. Create a new folder and enter it.
2. Download [`docker-compose.yml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/full-stack-bcn/samples/master/databases/postgres-pgadmin4/docker-compose.yml) and save it in the directory.
3. Issue the command:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

Alternatively, you can use [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit), which will snapshot a repository (that is, without the `.git` folder), and can even just copy a subfolder:

1. Install `degit` with:
   ```bash
   npm install -g degit
   ```
2. Extract a folder from the [Fullstack samples repository](https://github.com/full-stack-bcn/samples) into the `postgres` folder:
   ```bash
   degit full-stack-bcn/samples/databases/postgres-pgadmin4 postgres
   ```
