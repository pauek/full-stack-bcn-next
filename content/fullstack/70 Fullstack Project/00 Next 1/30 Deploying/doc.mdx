Deploying to Vercel is very easy:
- Create a NextJS project and do an **`npm run build`** to confirm that it compiles correctly.
- Create a repository and upload it to GitHub.
- Go to Vercel and sign-up or sign-in _using GitHub_.
- Create a new project on Vercel and choose the repository from the list of GitHub recent repositories and wait for Vercel to build it and assign a domain.

### Previews with branches

Whenever you create a new branch and push it to GitHub, Vercel will detect it and deploy a preview of that branch so that you can see the changes without affecting the production site.
