[NextJS](https://nextjs.org) is a _meta-framework_. Latest frameworks are a layer on top of old frameworks and provide more tools for the developer to make web apps. Here are some examples of this trend:

| Framework | Meta-framework |
| --------- | -------------- |
| React     | NextJS         |
| Vue       | NuxtJS         |
| Svelte    | SvelteKit      |
| Solid     | SolidStart     |
| Qwik      | QwikCity       |

### Meta-frameworks features

Whereas frameworks have been historically about frontend rendering, meta-frameworks assume that you write **_both frontend and backend_** in the same project.

- They all use **Javascript**, so frontend and backend use the same language and can share code.
- They usually map **folder structure** to URL structure.
- They let us choose where to render things (build time, server, client).
- They optimize things under the hood, without us having to worry about it.
- They have adapters to deploy our project either to Node.js on a server, or to many serverless platforms, by directly pushing to a branch.

### NextJS 13

NextJS 13 is a big step forward for NextJS:
- It is the first meta-framework to start using **React Server Components** (introduced in React 18).
- It has changed the folder structure from the Pages Router (the old version), to the [**App Router**](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) (the new version). We will be using the App Router exclusively.

### Creating a NextJS project

To create a new NextJS project, just type:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
``````

The initial options to choose for the project are:
- Name of the folder (as you wish).
- If Typescript should be used (**`yes`**).
- If ESLint should be used (**`yes`**).
- If [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) should be used (as you wish).
- If you want to use a separate `src/` directory (as you wish).
- If the **App Router** is used (**`yes`**).
- Customize default import alias (`no`).
