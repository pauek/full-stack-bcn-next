Route groups are directories whose name is inside parentheses `()`, and they allow routes inside to share layout

### Layouts for some part of the app

With a hierarchy like

<Image
  src="NextJS-Route-Groups-1.svg"
  width={1920}
  height={1080}
  alt="NextJS Route Groups Diagram"
/>

the `(shop)` group has a common layout, affecting both `/account` and `/cart`, but `/checkout` only has the root layout.

### Different root layouts

If there are different groups as children or `/app`, then each of these can have a different layout, which will become the root layout for each case:

<Image
  src="NextJS-Route-Groups-2.svg"
  width={1920}
  height={1080}
  alt="NextJS Route Groups Diagram 2"
/>
