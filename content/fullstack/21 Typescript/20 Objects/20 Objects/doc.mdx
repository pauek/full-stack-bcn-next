An object is a **table** (or map), associating _properties_ or _fields_ (of type `string`) to values (of type `any`). There is no need to declare any "class" or object template before creating objects:

```typescript
let emptyObj = {};
let person = {
  last: "Bond",
  first: "James",
  age: 27,
};
```

Access to properties is (almost universally) accomplished with the **`.`** operator:

```typescript
console.log(`My name is ${person.last}, ${person.first} ${person.last}`);
```

### Mutating objects

An object is a dynamic structure, so properties can be added

```typescript
person.weight = 80;
```

or deleted

```typescript
delete person.age;
```

Adding and removing properties to objects confuses the JIT, so in general it is a good idea to keep the structure of objects fixed if one cares about performance.

### Special names

Since internally the object is a table, properties do not need to be named like variable names. If they are they can be accessed normally, if not, they can be accessed with the brackets operator **`[]`**.

```typescript
let obj1 = {};
obj["full name"] = "Maximilian Schmitz";
```

This same notation can be used in initialization:

```typescript
let obj2 = {
  ['full name']: "Maximilian Schmitz II";
}
```

Since initialization uses the **`:`** separator between properties and values, we can even drop the brackets in that case:

```typescript
let obj3 = {
  'full name': "Maximilian Schmitz III";
}
```

This is the notation that gives rise to 
<Ref path="ts/ts-objects/json">JSON</Ref>.

### Checking for existence

Since if you are given an object, in advance you don't know what properties it can have. You can ask if an object has a property with the **`in`** operator:

```typescript
if ("first" in person) {
  console.log(`First name: ${person.first}`);
}
```

### Iterating properties

If you need to go over all the properties of an object you can use a special loop: **`for in`**. The loop gives, at every iteration the name of one of the properties of the object as a `string`.

```typescript
let obj = { x: 0.5, b: true, c: "hi" };
for (const prop in person) {
  console.log(`obj has property "${prop}" with value: ${obj[prop]});
}
```

### Special property functions

Three functions let us query for an objects inner associations:

|                       |                                                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `Object.keys(obj)`    | Returns an array of strings with `obj`s fields |
| `Object.values(obj)`  | Returns an array of values with `obj`s values  |
| `Object.entries(obj)` | Returns an array of pairs of key and value     |

### Abbreviations

When initializing an object:

```typescript
let first = "James";
let last = "Bond";
let age = 27;
let person = {
  first: first,
  last: last,
  age: age,
};
```

it seems wasteful to repeat the names of variables if they come from independent variables with the same name. So Javascript lets you write this instead:

```typescript
let first = "James";
let last = "Bond";
let age = 27;
// Take name and value from variable directly
let person = { first, last, age };
```
