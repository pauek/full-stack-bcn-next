The annotations for arrays have two equivalent forms. Arrays with fixed sizes are treated as tuples in Typescript.

### Bracket form

Arrays of simple values can be specified with:
```typescript
let a1 : number[] = [1, 2, 3];       // Array of numbers
let a2 : string[] = ["x", "y", "z"]; // Array of strings
let a3 : boolean[][] = [[true], [], [false, false]];
                                     // Array of arrays of booleans
```

### Generic form

Arrays can also be declared using the generic type `Array<T>`, which describes an array of cells of type `T`. This form is closer to other languages with generics like C++, Java, etc. The bracket form is actually translated to the generic form.

So the previous example can be written as:
```typescript
let a1 : Array<number> = [1, 2, 3];
let a2 : Array<string> = ["x", "y", "z"];
let a3 : Array<Array<boolean>> = [[true], [], [false, false]];
```

### Tuples

Brackets are also used to define [tuples](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/objects.html#tuple-types): types in which arrays have fixed numbers of elements, which can be considered tuples.

A tuple of two elements can be declared like this using a type alias:
```typescript
type Position = [number, number];
let p : Position = [0.5, 1.5];
```

The type `Position`, then, describes arrays with 2 elements in which both are of type `number`.

Tuples can be **`readonly`** so that Typescript will check that they are never written to:

```typescript
let dni : readonly [number, string] = [45458989, "X"];
console.log(dni[0]);
dni[0] = 0;
//  | 
// Cannot assign to '0' because it is a read-only property. ts(2540)
```

### Read-only arrays

In plain Javascript making variables `const` doesn't make the data they point to constant:

```typescript
const myArray = [1, 2, 3];
myArray.push(4);  // this is ok
myArray = []; // ERROR: cannot change to a different array
```

In Typescript you can declare a `readonly` array, which makes it impossible to call any mutating methods or changing the values of cells.

There are two ways of achieving this:
1. With **`readonly`** preceding the bracket notation:
   ```typescript
   let arr : readonly number[] = [1, 2, 3];
   ```

2. With the **`ReadonlyArray<T>`** type:
   ```typescript
   let arr : ReadonlyArray<number> = [1, 2, 3];
   ```
