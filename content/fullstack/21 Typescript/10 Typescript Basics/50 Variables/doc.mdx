A **variable** is a named box for a value of a certain type.

Variable declaration is accomplished with **`let`**:

```typescript
let a = 3;
let b1 = 10, b2 = 100, b3 = 1.01;
let c : any;
```

A constant can be declared with **`const`**. A constant needs an initial value and cannot be changed. It is important to mark true constants with `const` since compilers can make use of that information to produce faster code.

```typescript
const pi = 3.141592;
const folder = `/data/space-x/content`;
```

Global constants usually are defined in `ALL_CAPS`:

```typescript
const DB_USER = "groucho";
const DB_PORT = 8080;
```

### Variable names

Variables names in Typescript have [less constraints than in other languages](https://mothereff.in/js-variables). In Typescript variable names can contain `$` and unicode characters (including emojis!). Except for this, they are usually made from letters (both lowercase and uppercase) and digits (not at the beginning).
