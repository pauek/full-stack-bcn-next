Javascript is an imperative language, in the C family. Code consists of lists of **statements** usually ending in a semi-colon (**`;`**). Semicolons are optional but since they are inserted automatically, sometimes in particular cases they can mess up code.

**Comments** are like in C++ (**`//`** single-line, and **`/*`**+**`*/`** multi-line).

### Prettier

A good way not to fight semicolons (and many other style aspects) is to use a formatter like [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Associating a key with formatting code and formatting it automatically often leads to consistent code in projects.
