The `Promise` class has some static methods to help with promises.

### Promise.resolve, Promise.reject

These are methods to produce an already resolved `Promise` and an already rejected `Promise`:

```typescript
function adams() {
  return Promise.resolve(42);
}
```

```typescript
function giveMeError(msg: string) {
  return Promise.reject(msg);
}
```

### Promise.allSettled

[**`Promise.allSettled`**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/allSettled) is a function that receives an array of `Promise`s and `await`s all of them until all have either resolved or rejected (`Promise.all` is the old version, less convenient).

```typescript
const apiGet = (url: string) => {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  return await response.json();
}

const [users, beers] = await Promise.allSettled([
  apiGet('https://randomuser.me/api/'),
  apiGet('https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers'),
]);
```

The result is also an array (of the same size) with objects like:
```javascript
[
  { status: "fulfilled", value: result },
  { status: "rejected", reason: error },
]
```
