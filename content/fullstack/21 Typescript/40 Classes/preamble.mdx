The Javascript inheritance mechanism is quite different from the one found in other languages, since its is based on objects, not on types. This doesn't affect the way one organizes programs much, but it is important to understand it.

ES6 introduced a syntax closer to that of other languages and Typescript added more details to it, so this session is divided into two parts, one closer to old Javascript and the other to modern Typescript.
