Destructuring is the practice of declaring variables (either with `let` or `const`) that directly extract fields or cells from compound objects. Destructuring is typical in functional languages and Javascript has adopted several forms of destructuring that simplify coding in many ways.

### Getting an object's fields

Given an object like and some code that uses it, accessing every field through the original variable produces code that is readable but long:

```javascript
let message = {
  from: "James Bond",
  to: "M",
  text: "Target terminated",
};

console.log(`
From: ${message.from}
To: ${message.to}
Text: ${message.text}
`);
```

To make this shorter and equally readable, we can destructure the `message` first with:

```typescript
let { from, to, text } = message;
```

This instruction declares 3 variables which com from the fields of `message` with analogous names. They are initialized with the values found inside `message`, so destructuring is like the inverse of object creation. If the requested fields are not in `message`, then the variables are simply `undefined`.

Once the object is destructured, showing the message is clearer and shorter:

```typescript
console.log(`From: ${from}\nTo: ${to}\nText: ${text}`);
```

#### Nested objects

We can also destructure nested objects:

```typescript
let header = {
  title: "King Lear",
  size: { height: 121, height: 62 }
};
const { title, size: { width } } = header;
```

#### Mapping to new names

And map the given fields to new names:
```typescript
let person = {
  firstName: "James",
  lastName: "Bond"
};
// firstName -> first, lastName -> last
const { firstName: first, lastName: last } = person;
console.log(`${first} ${last}`);
```

#### Rest of fields

If we don't know the fields of an object except for two, the spread **`...`** syntax will accumulate the "rest" of the fields:

```typescript
const { text, ...other } = message;
```

The `other` variable refers to an object having all fields that are in `message` but which are not named `text`.

### Destructuring parameters

In functions that receive objects, destructuring can be made directly in the header, so this function:

```javascript
function showMessageText(msg) {
  const { text } = msg;
  console.log(`Text: ${text}`);
}
```

is exactly the same as this one

```javascript
function showMessageText({ text }) {
  console.log(`Text: ${text}`);
}
```

### Destructuring Arrays

Arrays can also be destructured using the notation:

```typescript
let [a, b, c] = someArray;
```

Here, `a`, `b` and `c` will be 3 variables taking the values of the first 3 cells of the array. If the array doesn't have enough cells, the variables that are outside the range will be `undefined`.

#### Rest of cells

The spread operator **`...`** has the same meaning that it has with objects, except it gets the rest in order:

```typescript
let A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let [head, ...rest] = A;
// head = 1
// rest = [2, 3, 4, 5]
```
